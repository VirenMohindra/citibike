## What This Actually Does

This isn't just another bike map. It's a complete transportation analytics platform that:

1. **Plans optimized Citibike routes** with real-time station availability
2. **Syncs your entire Citibike trip history** (including trips from years ago)
3. **Analyzes your transportation economics** - tells you when biking saves/costs money vs. subway
4. **Visualizes your riding patterns** with heat maps and trip statistics
5. **Recommends the optimal mode** for each trip based on distance, time, and cost

## Core Features

### 4. Transportation Economics Analysis

![Economics Dashboard](./public/demo/economics.png)

The killer feature. Understand whether Citibike is actually saving you money:

- **Cost breakdown**: Monthly spending on membership, e-bike fees, and overage charges
- **Subway comparison**: What you would have spent on subway for the same trips
- **Breakeven analysis**: How many trips you need to justify the membership
- **Savings tracking**: Year-to-date savings (or overspending) vs. subway
- **Optimization suggestions**: Specific recommendations to reduce costs
  - "Switch 8 e-bike trips to classic â†’ save $35/month"
  - "Avoid 3 trips over 45min â†’ save $18/month"

**Example insights:**

- "You spent $52.18 this month ($17.08 membership + $35.10 e-bike fees)"
- "Subway would have cost $87 (or $132 unlimited)"
- "You saved $34.82 vs pay-per-ride subway"
- "E-bikes cost you $5.20 per trip vs. $2.90 subway - consider classic bikes for trips under 2 miles"

### 5. Trip Statistics & Insights

![Trip Statistics](./public/demo/trip-stats.png)

Deep analytics on your riding behavior:

- **Total metrics**: Total rides, miles, hours on bikes
- **Bike type usage**: Classic vs. e-bike split with costs
- **Favorite routes**: Your most frequent station pairs
- **Time patterns**: When you bike most (day of week, time of day, month)
- **Environmental impact**: COâ‚‚ saved, calories burned, tree equivalents
- **Suitability scores**: How well each trip matched the "ideal Citibike use case"

![Trip Insights](./public/demo/insights.png)

### 6. Smart Trip Analysis

For each trip, calculates:

- **Time savings vs. subway**: Did you actually save time?
- **Cost comparison**: Was this cheaper than a subway ride?
- **Suitability score (0-100)**: How ideal was this trip for Citibike?
  - Factors: distance, duration, station availability, time of day
  - 80-100 = Great choice
  - 50-79 = Okay
  - 0-49 = Subway would have been better
- **Recommended mode**: What you should have taken (classic bike, e-bike, or subway)

### 7. Saved Routes & Favorites

- **Save routes**: Store frequent routes for one-tap planning
- **Favorite stations**: Quick access to your most-used stations
- **Route history**: Revisit past route plans
- **Export routes**: Download as GPX/KML for other apps

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** and npm
- **Mapbox Account** (free tier works fine)
  - Sign up: https://account.mapbox.com/
  - Create token: https://account.mapbox.com/access-tokens/

### Installation

**State**: Zustand (UI state), Dexie (IndexedDB for trip data), SWR (real-time data)
**Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
**Data**: Citibike GBFS API (station data), Lyft API (trip history)
**Deployment**: Progressive Web App (PWA) with offline support

## Documentation

- **[docs/](./docs/)** - Comprehensive documentation
  - Setup, development, and deployment guides
  - API documentation and reverse-engineering notes
  - Architecture and design patterns
  - Testing strategy

## Citibike Authentication (Optional)

This app supports **optional** Citibike account authentication. The Citibike/Lyft API is not public, so credentials must
be reverse-engineered from the iOS app.

### How to Obtain Credentials

See [docs/MITMPROXY_GUIDE.md](./docs/MITMPROXY_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions on using mitmproxy to intercept the
Citibike iOS app and extract:

- `CITIBIKE_CLIENT_ID`
- `CITIBIKE_CLIENT_SECRET`

**Note**: This is for personal use only. Credentials are stored in httpOnly cookies and never exposed to the client.

## Key Insights This App Provides

Based on analyzing 25,000+ real trips:

1. **E-bikes are expensive**: At $0.25/min (excluding tax), a 15-minute e-bike ride costs $3.90 vs. $2.90 for subway.
   E-bikes only make financial sense for trips under 11 minutes.

2. **Classic bikes have a sweet spot**: Free for 45 minutes means trips in the 20-35 minute range are highly
   cost-effective. Longer trips incur overage fees.

3. **Time value matters more than cost**: A 1.5-mile trip might save you 13 minutes vs. subway. At $60/hour, that's $13
   of value - far exceeding the ~$3 cost difference.

4. **Seasonal adjustment is critical**: NYC has ~4 months of harsh winter. Your effective monthly cost is higher than it
   appears: `$17.08 Ã— 12 Ã· 8 bikeable months = $25.62/month`.

5. **You need both systems**: Weather, long distances, and formal occasions require subway backup. The question isn't "
   Citibike vs. subway" - it's "which to use when?"

6. **Route-specific patterns exist**: Some routes heavily favor Citibike (direct, no subway transfers), others favor
   subway (long distance, direct subway line).

## Development

```bash
npm run dev          # Start dev server with Turbopack
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run lint         # Run ESLint
npm test             # Run Playwright tests
```

### Useful Commands

```bash
npm run test:e2e     # E2E tests only
npm run test:unit    # Unit tests only
npm run test:a11y    # Accessibility tests
npm run analyze      # Analyze bundle size
```
